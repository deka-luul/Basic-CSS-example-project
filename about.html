            <h2>Purpose of CSS</h2>
            <p>The purpose of CSS is to separate the content of a web page (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from its presentation (including layout, colors, and fonts). This separation improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enables multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of CSS</h2>
            <p>1. Improved Website Speed: By separating content from design, CSS reduces the amount of code on each page, leading to faster load times.</p>
            <p>2. Consistent Design: CSS allows for a uniform look across multiple pages, making it easier to maintain and update the design.</p>
            <p>3. Enhanced Accessibility: CSS can improve accessibility for users with disabilities by allowing for better control over layout and presentation.</p>
            <p>4. Easier Maintenance: Changes can be made in one CSS file that will affect the entire website, simplifying updates and maintenance.</p>
            <p>5. Greater Flexibility: CSS provides more options for layout and design, enabling more creative and complex designs.</p>
